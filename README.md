# Foodmart Database Analysis
Study and analysis of foodmart database to discover the context behind the database.

Foodmart database is one of the most common database that is suggested to beginners mostly when they start learning sql or for any other general database processing in datascience. However there is hardly any detail on this available on internet. It also lacks the relation between the tables which makes it even harder for the learners given that they are beginners.

This project is an attempt to study the database, and assess the roles each tables play and build context around it. I created a relationship matrix in Power BI and also created two cubes in SQL that gives sales correlation based on various dimensions.

I have also added the relationship matrix query which generates the list associated tables(dimension tables) with a fact table and the key coumn by which the dimension tables are related. This would be more helpful to beginners than providing a relationship diagram as it does not clutter all the tables at once, rather it helps user explore one table at a time at our convenience.
